CO2 Emissions Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the CO2 emissions of vehicles based on three key features:

Number of Cylinders

Engine Size

Combined Fuel Consumption

Using a regression model, this system estimates the amount of CO2 emitted by a vehicle, providing a valuable tool for understanding the environmental impact of different vehicle specifications. "The model utilizes machine learning techniques to generate accurate predictions based on a large vehicle data."
